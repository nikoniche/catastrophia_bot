# Catastrophia Discord Bot

Discord bot made to be used exclusively by the Catastrophia community Discord server.  
Catastrophia: https://www.roblox.com/games/1087852616/CATASTROPHIA-Survive  
Discord server: https://discord.gg/catastrophia-527084969089302531
  
The bot allows the server users to check their playtime in Catastrophia using slash commands. They can also view the top ranking players and link their server profile to their Roblox username.  
For administrators it adds a variety of commands to make server administration easier. The bot also has an unused cog for auto-moderation since Discord integrated a similar system on their own.

The bot relies on Catastrophia's API webserver: https://github.com/nikoniche/catastrophia_webserver
